**Solve common C++ problems with modern design patterns and build robust applications**

## What is this book about?
Design patterns is a library of reusable components designed for software architecture, not for concrete implementation. In this book, you’ll learn to recognize and apply various C++ design patterns and idioms. In this second edition, you’ll gain a deep understanding of design patterns and become empowered to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Recognize the most common design patterns used in C++
* Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve common design problems
* Explore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and their drawbacks
* Rediscover how to use popular C++ idioms with generic programming
* Discover new patterns and idioms made possible by language features of C++17 and C++20
* Understand the impact of design patterns on the program’s performance

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Database {
   class Storage { ... }; // Disk storage Storage S;
   class Index { ... }; // Memory index Index I;
   public:
     void insert(const Record& r);
 ...
};
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable programs and software systems.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).
