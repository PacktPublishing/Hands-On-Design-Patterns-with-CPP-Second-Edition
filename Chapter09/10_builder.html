    <p>
      Mary Had a Little Lamb
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Its fleece was white as snow
      </li>
      <li>
        And everywhere that Mary went
      </li>
      <li>
        The lamb was sure to go
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It followed her to school one day
      </li>
      <li>
        Which was against the rules
        <ul>
          <li>
            It made the children laugh and play
          </li>
          <li>
            To see a lamb at school
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        And so the teacher turned it out
      </li>
    </ul>
